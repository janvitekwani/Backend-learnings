######### Getting start with the spring and why ?##########
you can build variety of applications using java, spring and spring boot
.web 
.rest API
.full stack
.microservices

Irrespective of the app you are building
   .spring framework provides all the core features
      -understanding spring helps you learn spring boot easily
       -help in debugging problems quickly


### GOAL : Understand core features of spring framwork
    APPROACH : build a loose coupled hello world gaming app with 
                modern spring approach 

   . GET handon with spring and understand
     why  spring?
    terminology?
        .tight coupling and loose coupling
        .ioc container
        .application context
        .component scan 
        .dependency injection 
        .auto wiring 

we will design an iterative , and in each approach we will do something or other


how to download projects form the spring intialiser ?
. best way to make the spring project is to go the start.spring.go website
             ( this is called the spring initializr)
. version of spring boot to choose while intializer i.e. 3.0.0 and snapshot 
  version , right now there is no release version for Springboard three

. when u give a group id and artifact id, group id and artifact id are very similar
  to package and class name
  
      
ITERATION 1 : Tightly Coupled java code
           .gamerunner class
           .game classes: Mario, SuperContra , Pacman etc
what is coupling?
so coupling is how much work is involved in changing something ?
   even in real world , a engine is tightly coupled to a car
    whereas a wheel is loosely coupled to a car

coupling is even more important in building great software
     .business requirement changes
     .frameworks changes
     .code changes
 .we want loose coupling as much as possible
.we want to make functional changes as less code changes as possible


ITERATION 2 : LOOSE COUPLING -interfaces
           .gamerunner class
           .gamingconsole interface
LET explore how java interfaces and spring framework help with 
            loose coupling!

   so for the loose coupling what we have changed
 
      EARILER                                      NOW
gameRunner - runinng the three class            gameRunner - interface(gaming console)- all the gamming classes 
                                                                                            implementing the interface
