what is the difference between the PRIMARY AND QUALIFIER -Which one to use?

for eg : 
    @Component @Primary
    class QuickSort implement SortingAlgorithm {}

    @Component
    class BubbleSort implement SortingAlgorithm {}

    @Component
    class ComplexAlgorithm 
// we want a sorting algorithm and give me the one with highest priority
      @Autowired
      private SortingAlgorithm algorithm;

   @Component
    class AnotherComplexAlgorithm 
        @Autowired @Qualifier ("RadixSortQualifier")  // by using the @qualifier we are saying that we have to make use of
            // any specific sorting algorithm 
        private SortingAlgorithm iWantToUseRadixSortOnly;

**** so here we conclude that if u are okay with any sorting algorithm then use @Autowired and if u want any 
     specific sorting algorithm then use @Autowired @Qualifier  **********



@Primary - a bean should be given prefernce when multiple candidates are qualified
@Qualifer - a specific bean should be auto-wired (name of the bean can be used as qualifier)
.ALWAYS think fromn the perspective of the class using the SortingAlgorithm 
 1 Just @Autowired : Give me (perferred ) Sorting algorithm 
 2 @Autowired + @Qualifier : I only want to use spe(re
(remeber) @qualifier has higher priority then @Primary
