default initalisation of spring is -eager
Eager inititalization is recommended:
  . errors in config are discovered immediately at application
     startup
However , you can configure beans to be lazily initialized
  using lazy annotation
   . not recommended(And) not frequently used
.Lazy annotation 
   .can be used almost everywhere @Component and @Bean are used
   . lazy resolution proxy will be injected instead of actual dependency
   .can be used on Configuration (@Configuration) class:
      .all @Bean methods within the @Configuration will be lazily initialized

   lazy initalisation is done only when lots of initalisational logic is involved



     ### COMPARING LAZY INITIALIZATION AND EAGAR INTIALIZATION
