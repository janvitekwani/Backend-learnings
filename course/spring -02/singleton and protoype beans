Spring Bean SCopes 
by default all the bean created in spring is singelton means same
instance is returned in string beans
Singleton - one object instance per Spring IOC container

by if u want the different instance beans to created each time then u can go for 
prototype
prototype = possibly many object instances per spring IOC container


*** @Scope (value =ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)  ***// for creating the different instances 
*** @Scope (value =ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON) ***

Scopes application only for web aware Spring application context
request - one object instance per single Http request
session - one object instance per user http session '
application - one object instance per web application runtime
websocket- one object instance per websocket instance

>Java singleton vs Spring SIngleton 
  .spring singleton : one object instance per spring ioc container
   .java singleton : one object instance per jvm

   spring singleton and java singleton might mean the same if u are running one
   IOC container per jvm , however is u are running the multiple ioc container than 
   spring container are differnt from java container


prototype are statefull means if u want to contain the information about the multiple user 
across the beans then we use the protoype

and if we want to pass the same information then we will use the singleton prototype
