if u want to do some intilaisation as soon as the constructor is ready 
then u can make use of the @PostConstruct

what is happening actually in @PostConstruct case ?
the spring would autowire the dependencies in and as soon it is auto wired 
the spring will call the method associate with the post construct



u can also use something which is used before a bean is terminated 

@PreDestory



where we can use postconstruct  and predestory ?
if u want to some intialisation logic as soon as dependenies are wired in 
such as fetch some data from the database then u can use the postconstruct

and u want to do some cleanup before the bean is removed from the container then 
use the predestory
