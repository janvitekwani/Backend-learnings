           /               request                   \            /

 chrome , firefox                                    JAVA PROGRAM (servlet) so this java program is excuting on server not on client therefore this java 
 ( CLIENT  )                                          ( SERVER)             program is called as servlet
     \                                        .dynamic web page request 
      \                                                 /
       \   _ _ _    _  _  _    _  _    _     _    _    /                                            
                        response

so that java program which is excuted on server is called as servlet , this is base of spring and 
spring boot frame work

their is many server for java like tomcat . but java technology servlet is independent of server 
so we can use any server we want
