servlet is simple java program that runs on server and capable of handling request 
and generating dynamic response

           /               request                   \            /
         /                                            \         /jdbc

 chrome , firefox                                    JAVA PROGRAM (servlet) so this java program is excuting on server not on client therefore this java 
 ( CLIENT  )                                          ( SERVER)             program is called as servlet
     \                                        .dynamic web page request 
      \                                                 /
       \   _ _ _    _  _  _    _  _    _     _    _    /                                            
                        response

so that java program which is excuted on server is called as servlet , this is base of spring and 
spring boot frame work

their is many server for java like tomcat . but java technology servlet is independent of server 
so we can use any server we want 


## Installing the apache tomcat server
step 1 if u want to install jdk by anychance
* u have to check the lts version of java because lts versions are the last long version

step 2 now we can download the tomcat and check the tomcat version 32bit/64bit version installer
step 3  check host manager and examples too then after doing next we have to specifiy the port according
        to or need so we will the port 8080 to 9494 ** but u should take the port which is free**
 then give the user name and password 
      for ROLE : put ",manager-script"  // this will make it easier to configure with the ecllipse and
       netbeans

      this fetched the java path dynamically otherwise u have to give the java path (jdk)

step 4: is see that are tomcat server is set up then uncheck show and check run apache tomcat this 
         u will see server is running and it will show a server running window  

step 5: now to check that tomcat is running or not go to the webbrowser put "localhost:8080" and check do
         server is running if it running then u will see the apache tomcat home page open on that server

       to check that servers are running or not running then u can go to the manager apps then it ask for the password
       and username which they already asked for the while setup tomcat , now center will open now from here u can 
        deploy the files manually 

step 6: but we will not deploy files like these we will connect tomcat with id and then deploy the files 

C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.1 path for tomcat and u should give all the permmission to tomcat as admin 
if no permission is not given 


##  confriguring eclipse with tomcat ( we are doing this to get system automatically deploy )

step 1: first open the ecllipse ide 
step 2: go on the top right corner ( hover on the option and select open perpective )
       and select java EE , click open
step 3: on the lower panel select the servers if "no server are avaliable click on server and create new server"
      or u can go the windows
step 4: then from the apache folder and select the tomcat v10.1 server and select it 
        and then click next browse and give the permission and give the tomcat permission C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 10.1 
        and after finish server is confrigured.
       

## what is the difference between tomcat version 9 and tomcat version 10 

in tomcat 10 javaEE is switched from jakartaEE 9
. eariler we used to have javaEE where we have javax library but now ot has 
become jakartaEE

. javax code will run in server tomcat 9 only
