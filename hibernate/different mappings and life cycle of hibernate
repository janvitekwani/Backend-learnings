let's understand the life cycles of the hibernate


   where it is object it has some properties but when we store in database
   it is stored in the form of tables 

  Now let's understand different stages of objects

      we have two things 1) database 2) session object - this object has various methods , create delete update query 
      so session object put the object in the database

      we have different states

       Transient                            persistent
          State                               state


         Detached                              Removed 
            State                                 state
