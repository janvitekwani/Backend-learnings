hibernate is an orm tool :
hibernate is a java framework that simplifies the development of java application 
to interact with the database.
Hibernate is the ORM (object relational mapping ) tool.
             Q. what do u mean by object relational mapping?
             A. object - mean to store the data in the database we use the object 
               and relational database mean we use the table and means one field of the object 
               will get mapped with the other field of the object , other feild will get mapped with other 
                feild of the object.
       
Hibernate is an open source , lightweight.  
Hibernate is a non- invasive framework, means it wont't forces the programmers to extend/
implement any class/interface.  
Any type of application can build with Hibernate FrameWork  

  

ALL THE CONCEPT OF THE HIBERNATE IS BASED ON PJOS(PLAIN JAVA OBJECT )

  TRADITIONAL WAY TO SAVE DATA (JDBC)


  
     when we want to store in my                                   to store the data in database we create table 
     application then we use to create 
            obejct


                                      and with the help of JDBC we can 
                                        connect objects and tables 
                                              together

  HOW HIBERNATE ROLE COMES INTO PICTURE

                    

       DATA IN OBJECTS                                           TABLE IN DATABASe

                         HIBERNATE ( with the help of hibernate we donot need to write any 
                                       kind of queries in the hibernate) 
                                   
                             - we need to write the database through objects 


so in background class get connected with the table in the database by mapping so either you can use xml or u can do mapping though java annotation 
hibernate is the persistance tool .
