       get()                                           load()

get method of hibernate session returns              load() method throws
null if object is not found in cache as              objectNotFoundEXCEPTION if object is not found
well as on database                                   on cache as well as on database but never return 
                                                       null


get() involves database hit if object doesn't          load method can return proxy in place and only initialze 
exists in session Cache and returns a fully             the object or hit the database if any methid other than getId()
initialized object which may involve several            is called on persistent or entity object . This lazy initialization
database call                                          increase the performance.

use if u are not sure that objects exits in the         use if u are sure that objects exists
database or not 




     Let deepy understand how get and load works ?
session object work as the buffer it take cache memory of the database
when  u call the get then session object , will come to session cache memory , so it will get the 
 object from the get () method of the object 
 let's say u cleared the get memory then it will not get the object in the session object in cache memory
 then only it will call the database


 load() will return a proxy object , but when u will use it inside name , then only it will uses the 
 database and then it will intialises the database
