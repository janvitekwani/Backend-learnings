this is the greatest module in spring for making web application
then we will use different things along with spring mvc

what is spring MVC?
1)(model view controller) spring mvc is sub framework of spring framework which is 
used to build a web application 
2) it is build on the top of the servlet api
3) it follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern , this was the only
   problem with servelt and jsp that they we not based on model view controller
Model - data , view - presentation layer , controller - which controls that with whom control will be
4) it implements all the basic features of a core spring framework like inversion of control,
  dependency injection


why spring mvc? when we had servlet and jsp 
1) it seperate each role modal,view,controller etc.
2) powerful configuration (as will use all the config of spring core )
3) we can make it lossely cuppled due to spring otherwise in servlet it was tightly 
  cuppled , u can make object wherever u want but here this will not happen u will not 
  make the object string will provide u with objects

4) Rapid application development 
5) spring mvc is flexible means , u can use jsp along with it, if u are not 
   getting what jsp is than u can use any other framework , easy to test and 
   much features
  

##### ____  MVC DESIGN PATTERN  ____  ##### 
this is not only for java , python or anyother language it is more of how will u 
design your things 

design pattern means how do u organise your code , how do u right them so your
element remain  lossely cuppled ( means they remain separate so that u can do 
maintains easily)

model - data , view - present data to user , controller- interface b/w model and view 
                                                   basically controlls whom to give data.
this helps in writting the clean code.

Q. what is the basic role of servlet and jsp?
A. jsp is made only for view , servlet is used to process the business logic , request
  is coming that is identified using servlet. servlet execpt the request and jsp shows the 
  data and the data which is going can be object or a data class that is storing the object

  so u this is how u can use jsp and servlet as model view and controller , by the way 
  html is also used in it but html is used for static pages and jsp is used for dynamic 
  pagees
