1) resources folder( where u can keep your resources)
   static - where u can keep the static files, templates - where we can keep the templates
    appliaction.properties - here u can mention , if u want to change the port , configure path 

2)mvnw.cmd & mvnw - this the utility for using the command line rather
                   so if u are using ecllipse as ide u can delete it 

3) porm.xml - main project is prom.xml
