JPA (java persistence API) java persistence(permanent storing) api

JPA is a orm tool means object relational mapping ( orm is a third party application)
   Q. what is the role of the ORM ?
   A. now u made a object based program in java that can be understood by the database by using the 
       with the help of ORM 
//if u donot use ORM then u need to write the query and SQL manually 

   their is two tasks of the ORM ?
   1) saves the object in the database
   2) handle SQL by itself
   3) and whenver we need a table form orm then it will convert it into table
      and give it back to u.

  ## HOW ORM ACTUALLY WORKS?  // we just have to do mapping and rest all the things are handled by orm   
                                   this is how table will form for user
  class USER                   | id  | Name  | city  |  profile |
{                              |     |       |       |          |
   int id                      |     |       |       |          |   
    String name                
    String city                so we map id field from id colunm 
    String profile              name fielf from name colum
                                city feild from city colum   ( so this much 
  }                                                           work we have to do 
                                                         by ourself)
                                                so their is two ways of doing mapping 
                                             either we can use XML or java annotations.( we learn
                                                                           these things in detailed when we
                                                                             use hibernate)

  ### NOW LET's TALK ABOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JPA AND HIBERNATE
   jpa is just a  specification which say to follows these things and your data
   will be stored, here it is only specification their is no implementation 

   so actual implementation of jpa is hibernate , the things specified in jpa is implemented
    by hibernate   other implementation like hibernate , ecllipse link , open jpa


 *** JPA provides to interfaces EntityMAnagerfactory , entityManager (provide methods) (object which performs all this function)   
                                                         create, update, read, delete

Q. how to use spring boot makes easier to perform operation with JPA 
A. spring boot auto configure everything so we have to add the dependency
       spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
 
      USER ( we have to perform                 CRUD respository( it is the spring
                operations with user object)       ^               interface ) // this will provide all the 
                                                   |  (extends                           functionally to perform database operations 
                        USER RESPOSITORY( so database layer                  ---extends---->       JPA REPOSITORY
                                   we will form the user repository)      /                 ( if u donot want to implement crud repository so their is
                                                                                                  child of it i.e.jPA respository they work same just
                                                                                                jpa has some extra featues )

Q. how to use JPA in sts?
    

    1) first starter with new spring starter project , give all the necessary details
    2) add the dependency , sql driver , spring data jpa and we will not add the web dependency
         because we want our application to be stand alone.
     you can get maven dependencies - u can see all the dependency hibernate-core 5.4 
 
   3) third make another package
